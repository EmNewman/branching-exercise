I have a broken git repo, help me fix it!

I have multiple branches each with their own new feature.

Unfortunatly, I donâ€™t know git very well... please clone my repo and get all of my features into the master branch!

Once you're done, submit a pull request on Github so I can use all my new features.

Thanks!
